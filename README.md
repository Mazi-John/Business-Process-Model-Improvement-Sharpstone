# BUSINESS-PROCESS-IMPROVEMENT-Sharpstone Jewelry

**How can we reduce the time it takes online clients to pay for the products in their order? Thatâ€™s the problem question that this business process modeling project aimed to solve.**

Sharpstone Jewelry Store has always been an online store until it assumed the status of a hybrid business by also becoming a brick-and-mortar store that walk-in clients could visit. 
90% of its jewelry orders are generated online through social media while walk-in clients and website purchases account for the rest. 
The company deals in very high-quality ornaments and custom-made jewelry such as rings, necklaces, earrings and bracelets. They come in gold, silver, titanium, moissanite and diamonds. 

In summary, the business process model project documented the context of the organization, the functional flow, cross-functional flow and the current state sales process map.
A value stream analysis of the current state sales process map resulted in additional steps that created urgency and increased anticipation in the client leading to a drastic
reduction in the time taken by clients to pay for an online order (ranging from hours to a no-show to an average of 60 minutes).
